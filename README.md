Python program
guide users to a better understanding and appreciation of how animals on the Serengeti plains can accelerate from rest to
capture their prey or avoid being captured.

The aim of the museum exhibition is to explain how both predator and prey can accelerate to
chase/avoid their adversary. The museum director would like you to write a Python program that
allows patrons to see how quickly these animals can accelerate and run.   program will calculate
the motion of such animals and show a comparison with the fastest humans over a distance of 100 m.
program will also model a chase between a predator and a prey.

The museum  like you to give context to your calculations by making a comparison
between the motion of a mammal on the Serengeti with the fastest human sprinters

We will assume that the animal starts from rest, accelerates to top speed and then continues running
at the top speed for a specified time. We will also assume that all motion is in a straight line.
While accelerating, we will assume that the speed of the animal increases from zero to the maximum
running speed, vmax, in a linear fashion
